# Commands, but better

## Reasoning
The Vanilla datapack and command system is great and there are many creations, that can be done. Though, when trying some stuff you have to do weird tricks
or it is straight up impossible. Editing playerdata is and will always be impossible, but Mojang wants to add commands that can do everything that could be
done when editing playerdata. It just takes them years. This is a proof of concept for many requested commands and features.
